// Two Operation 
// 1. Change(a,b) : O(logn) (using segement tree)
// 2. maxEdge(a,b) : O(log^2(n)) (using segement tree)

// Special Child: Among all child nodes of a node, the one with maximum sub-tree size is
// is considered as special child. Each non leaf node has exactly one Special child

// Special Edge: For each non-leaf node, the edge connecting the node with its
// special child is considered as Special Edge.
